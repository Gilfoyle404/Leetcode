   Question - You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
              Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
              Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
              Notice that you may not slant the container."""
